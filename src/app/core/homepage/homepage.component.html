<h1>Welcome Traveller !</h1>

<p>
	You can go wandering in the wild and fight whatever you might encounter, but don't forget, may your life be reduce to 0, and it will be
	the end for you !
</p>

<p>Visit the inn to rest and restore your life if you need to, though you will need gold to rent the room !</p>

<p>
	You can go train yourself against opponent you have slay before at the Mist Arena, may you be too scared to explore new area of the world
</p>

<p>Enjoy your life while you can ! Farewell !</p>
